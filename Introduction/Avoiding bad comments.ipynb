    "# Avoiding bad comments\n",
    "\n",
    "如你所知，Python的特徵(所有Python程式設計師都喜歡)是容易理解的語法。但是除了語法本身之外，\n",
    "還有其他一些重要因素也可以提高程式的可讀性。 我們假設您已經熟悉註釋以及它們如何幫助您學習新語言。\n",
    "\n",
    "As you already know, a Python feature (beloved by all Python programmers) is its well-readable syntax. However, apart from the syntax itself, there are other important things that contribute to the readability of your program. We assume that you are already familiar with comments and how they help in learning a new language.\n",
    "\n",
    "在實際程式中，隨著程式變得越來越大和越來越複雜，註釋變得尤為重要。 沒有它們，即使在編寫程序後的幾個月內，您甚至可能也會感到困惑，更不用說其他第一次看到您的代碼的開發人員了。 但是寫註釋也有一個缺點，那就是說更多不一定代表更好，我們也將在下面進行討論。\n",
    "\n",
    "In real programs, comments become especially important as the program gets bigger and more complicated. Without them, things may get confusing even for you within a few months after writing the program, not to mention other developers who see your code for the first time. However, there is also a downside of making comments, meaning that more is not necessarily better, and we will discuss it below as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.When not to write comments?\n",
    "\n",
    "這聽起來可能很奇怪，但有時最好不要寫註解。 精心編寫的它們確實可以提高程序的可讀性，但這並不意味著您應該盡可能地增加它們。 相反，許多程式設計師相信，好的程式碼起初不需要任何註釋，因為它是如此透明和準確。 這就是我們所有人都應針對的目標。 因此，如果可以使代碼變得不言自明，則註釋是不必要的，最好更改代碼。 讓我們重點介紹開發人員需要少註釋的情況。\n",
    "\n",
    "This may sound strange but sometimes it's better not to write comments at all. Carefully written, they can indeed contribute to the readability of your program, but it doesn't mean you should include them wherever you can. On the contrary, many programmers are convinced that a good piece of code doesn't require any comments in the first place, for it is so transparent and accurate. That is what we all should aim at. So, if code can be made self-explanatory, comments are unnecessary, and it's better to change the code. Let's highlight cases when developers need to comment less.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ 如果一個註釋說明變數/函數，則通常可以刪除註釋並透過明確化命名變量/方法本身來減少註釋。 比較下面的程式碼：\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "+ If a comment explains a variable/function, you can usually delete the comment and explicitly name the variable/method itself. Compare the following lines of code:"

    "+ 通常，註解應回答\"why\"而不是\"What\"的問題。 但是，對於初學者來說，自己編寫註釋來解釋程式碼的作用可能會很有用，尤其是在使用新近學習的語法表達式時，例如：\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Generally, comments should answer the question \"why\" as opposed to \"what\". However, it may be useful for beginners to write comments for themselves explaining what the code does, especially when using a newly learned syntax expression, e.g.:\n"

    "\n",
    "在註釋程式碼時，重要的是要知道在哪裡畫線。 程序過分註釋和註釋不足都可能難以理解，從而導致浪費時間和不愉快的時間來處理此類代程式碼。 因此，您應該始終嘗試僅在必要時謹慎地寫註釋。\n",
    "\n",
    "學習這樣做的最簡單方法就是做到這一點。 在您僅開始編碼時就開始練習是個好主意，因為您會習慣它，而到了解決一些更複雜的問題時，您就會知道如何正確編寫註釋。 從現在開始，嘗試在代碼中包含簡單的註釋，以解釋使您花一些時間才能理解的困難時刻。 回來查看較舊的程序並查看如何增強它們（包括註釋）也很有用。\n",
    "\n",
    "When annotating the code, it's important to know where to draw the line. Both over- and undercommented programs can be difficult to understand, resulting in wasted and unpleasant time spent working with such pieces of code. So, you should always try to write comments carefully and only when necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest way to learn to do so is just by doing it. It's a good idea to start practicing when you only start coding because you will get used to it, and by the time some more complex problems should be solved, you will know how to write comments properly. From now on, try to include simple comments in your code to explain difficult moments that took you a while to understand. It is also useful to get back to review your older programs and see how they (including comments) could be enhanced."
